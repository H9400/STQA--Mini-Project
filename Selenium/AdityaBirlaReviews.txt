My sister was suffering from a surging lump in her neck, and it was a nightmare for her since she was not able to sleep. She consulted her, and the same day the surgeon very professionally undertook the sugery. It took about half an hoir only. The pain was receding day by day and by 3rd week, she was close to normal. Surgeons at this hospital are a lifesaver, 5 stars for the treatment

Extremely Satisfied with treatment
Sep 13, 2022 04:46 PM 847 Views (via Mobile)
I am Dr. Leena Patil living in kamal heights, Dattanagar, Theregoan.My teeth were having big gaps in between and my bite was not proper. So I took treatment from your orthodontist, Dr. Shrenik Oswal.

After the completion of my treatment, the gaps between the teeth were negligible and my bite also improved. After the treatment, there is a tremendous change in my smile and I feel more confident than before.

Dr. Shrenik Oswal is a very good orthodontist and a good person, he treats his patients with love and care.

I am extremely satisfied with the treatment provided by the dental department.

Thank you very much, Dr. Shrenik Oswal sir, and your team.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,

Dr. Leena Patil

Satisfactory treatment
Sep 07, 2022 03:04 PM 887 Views
I visited here for diagnosis to a dermatologist for a bacterial skin infection that I was facing for one year. Initially visits were focused on administering oral antibiotics on the skin followed by topical antibiotics after a while, which showed drastic results briskly. It was a very effective therapy with skin condition back to normal

Extremely Satisfied with treatment
Sep 13, 2022 04:46 PM 847 Views (via Mobile)
I am Dr. Leena Patil living in kamal heights, Dattanagar, Theregoan.My teeth were having big gaps in between and my bite was not proper. So I took treatment from your orthodontist, Dr. Shrenik Oswal.

After the completion of my treatment, the gaps between the teeth were negligible and my bite also improved. After the treatment, there is a tremendous change in my smile and I feel more confident than before.

Dr. Shrenik Oswal is a very good orthodontist and a good person, he treats his patients with love and care.

I am extremely satisfied with the treatment provided by the dental department.

Thank you very much, Dr. Shrenik Oswal sir, and your team.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,

Dr. Leena Patil

I visited here for diagnosis to a dermatologist for a bacterial skin infection that I was facing for one year. Initially visits were focused on administering oral antibiotics on the skin followed by topical antibiotics after a while, which showed drastic results briskly. It was a very effective therapy with skin condition back to normal

My sister was suffering from a surging lump in her neck, and it was a nightmare for her since she was not able to sleep. She consulted her, and the same day the surgeon very professionally undertook the sugery. It took about half an hoir only. The pain was receding day by day and by 3rd week, she was close to normal. Surgeons at this hospital are a lifesaver, 5 stars for the treatment

Extremely Satisfied with treatment
Sep 13, 2022 04:46 PM 849 Views (via Mobile)
I am Dr. Leena Patil living in kamal heights, Dattanagar, Theregoan.My teeth were having big gaps in between and my bite was not proper. So I took treatment from your orthodontist, Dr. Shrenik Oswal.

After the completion of my treatment, the gaps between the teeth were negligible and my bite also improved. After the treatment, there is a tremendous change in my smile and I feel more confident than before.

Dr. Shrenik Oswal is a very good orthodontist and a good person, he treats his patients with love and care.

I am extremely satisfied with the treatment provided by the dental department.

Thank you very much, Dr. Shrenik Oswal sir, and your team.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully,

Dr. Leena Patil

Satisfactory treatment
Sep 07, 2022 03:04 PM 889 Views
I visited here for diagnosis to a dermatologist for a bacterial skin infection that I was facing for one year. Initially visits were focused on administering oral antibiotics on the skin followed by topical antibiotics after a while, which showed drastic results briskly. It was a very effective therapy with skin condition back to normal
